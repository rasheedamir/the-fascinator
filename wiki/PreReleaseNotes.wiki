#summary Running notes on the next release currently under development.

= Next Version: v1.0.6 =

A textual summary/description of the release goes here... currently just bug fixes/tweaks.

*Release Date:* TBA... see [ReleaseHistory earlier releases].

*Release Notes:* (so far... this version is unreleased)

 * A new 'Delete by Query' action has been added to the portal, allowing admins to script mass deletions somewhat easier. It is coded to run in 'test' mode only until edited by an admin... for safety reasons. r3123
