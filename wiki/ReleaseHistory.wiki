#summary Details on the current release and all historic releases.

= Current Release v1.0.5 =

Major works on system messaging for robustness and improved functionality. The Solr Event Log Subscriber and the !ReIndex tool also got some long overdue tender loving care.

*Release Date:* 04 October 2011

*Release Notes:*

 * Stage 2 [BackupMigrationToolPlanning restore tool] implemented (issue #10), allowing harvest file OID remapping and inclusion of custom migration scripts. (issue #57) Migration from one host to another should now be possible.
 * Added new 'History' screen to display Solr log for object. r3071
 * Solr logging configuration fixed. (issue #58)
 * Numerous minor fixes to 'about' pages. (issue #54, issue #55, issue #56)
 * Object deletion is more robust when small sections error. r3064
 * Some timing issues and bugs resolved in !SubscriberQueueConsumer. ID generation now uses [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html UUIDs] r3080
 * Significant work on messaging: r3083
   * Some core messaging features previously in the Portal having been centralised to the Core Library. It is now possible to start AMQ without a Portal from inside unit tests.
   * Message queue bootup delays at system start are no longer hardcoded. Servers with slow Solr boot times can accommodate.
   * Some new experimental work on transaction management provides alternative to traditional tool chains. A new '`TransactionManager`' plugin supports this.
   * '`MessagingServices`' should handle a lot of edge case errors to do with abnormally terminating sessions. It is also quite trivial now to send JMS messages to other systems as well.
   * Message statistics can now be routed by configuration, and disabled if desired.
 * Objects posting messages to the tool chain can now be configured regarding the specific queue to use. r3085

= v1.0.4 =

This release focuses on significant updates to the [LoggingFrameworks logging framework] 'plumbing' throughout the platform. There are also a number of bug fixes and the test release of a new restoration process.

*Release Date:* 22 August 2011

*Release Notes:*

 * Work on [LoggingFrameworks logging frameworks] to address bugs caused by Solr version upgrade.
 * Solr Indexer now binds access to the '`log`' object to the Jython engine, making it accessible inside of rules files. (issue #43)
 * Implement [BackupMigrationToolPlanning Stage 1 of re-index/restore] tool. (issue #46)
 * Minor improvement to File System Storage Plugin when it finds objects without an 'objectId' property. Needs further work (issue #48), this 'fix' is just a workaround.
 * !FileSystemHarvester's new database cache has been added to developer purge scripts. (issue #6)
 * Fixed an occasional number parsing error in House Keeping. (issue #8).
 * Some work-around fixes to OAI-PMH harvest problems added to sample rules file. More work is required in the harvester (issue #49).
 * Fixed threading bug in file lock unit test. (issue #28)
 * Improved several contrib plugins to allow the [https://redbox-build.cqu.edu.au/jenkins/ build server] to do automated documentation builds now that they are separated from the core Fascinator POMs.
 * Fixed Atom Feed bugs resulting from code being out-of-date. (issue #50)
